### This is a personal network overlay mesh project inspired by Wireguard, Nebula, Tailscale, and others. 
### It is a WIP and cannot be considered secure, or ready for any real use

The goal is to learn more about crypto in networking, noise protocol framework, AEAD ciphers, tunneling/microtunneling,
concurrency, kernel network APIs, etc. Wireguard is an excellent solution, I just wanted to write my own for knoweldge/experience/personal reasons.
